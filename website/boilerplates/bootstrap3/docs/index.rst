Aldryn Boilerplate Bootstrap 3 is the most complete **django CMS** based
Boilerplate for rapid development. It uses the full potential of the
`Bootstrap <http://getbootstrap.com/>`_ framework for developing responsive,
mobile-first projects on the web, and implements various best practices from
within the front-end community.

This Boilerplate can be used with standalone django CMS websites as well as
on the `Aldryn <http:// www.aldryn.com/>`_ cloud platform.

The latest stable version is available on GitHub -
