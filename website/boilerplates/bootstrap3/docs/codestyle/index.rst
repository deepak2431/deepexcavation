Coding Style
############

.. note::

    Compare to the :doc:`/guidelines/index` and the :doc:`/structure/index`
    we offer many more coding conventions, most of them are being covered by
    certain linting tools such as ESLint and CSS Lint. You will also find good
    practice and common sense here. Yet note that these are conventions and
    eventually will make their way to the guidelines.
